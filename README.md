## Install phievo


Since _phievo_ is not pusblished on any offical repository yet, you need to install it manually.

### install Anaconda
In case python is not already installed on your computer, we recommand to install it via the [anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

Among other things, anaconda provides the standard package manager of python _pip_. _pip_ can upgrade itself, it is generally recommanded to do so before starting the installation process.

```bash
	pip install --upgrade pip
```

When python2 and python3 are installed on the same computer, it is common to need to specify the version of python or pip you are using: `python` (`pip`) for python2 and `python3` (`pip3`) for python3. Make sure you verify which command correspond to python3 on you computer.

### install the package


Simply run the following command:
```bash
	sudo pip install dist/phievo-1.0.tar.gz
```

## Instructions specific to windows

### Install gcc
Windows does not come with the `gcc` compiler installed but the free software foundation provides a minimal distribution of the gnu softwares for windows, it is called [MinGW](http://mingw.org/).

Once you have downloaded `mingw-get-setup.exe`, run it. A selection panel will open. We recommend you to install at least the two following packages(the others are not relevant for phievo):
- mingw-developper-toolkit
- mingw32-base

Choose the default directory.

After the installation is finished, update windows `PATH` so that it knows where to look for _gcc_ command. Open a the command prompt and run:

```bash
setx PATH "%path%;C:\MinGW\bin"
```

**Note:** If you may use other coding distribution such as code blocks or visual basics that already  contain the _gcc_ compiler. In such case, you do not need to install MinGw. Just upload you `PATH` so that windows knows where is the gcc compiler.

## Instructions specific to OSX

### Install gcc
OSX does not have the gcc compiler installed by default. There are different way to install it. The fastest is probably via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install gcc
```

If _gcc_ is not already installed on you system (via macports or Xcode), _homebrew_'s _gcc_ should be automatically in the system's `PATH`.

## Example: Static Hox

Copy the project directory `StaticHox` from `Examples` where you want to run it. Then copy `run_evolution` at the same place as `StaticHox`.

To launch the evolution, simply run

```bash
	./run_evolution -m StaticHox
```

On windows machine  we recommand that you explicitly tell the system that you are running python (make sure you use the good version).

```bash
	python run_evolution -m StaticHox
```

## Build the documentation

To build the documentation, go to the `docs` directory and run

```bash
make html
```
the documentation is built in `docs/build/html` by default.

Note that you may need to run make html twice because the build process uses the package _numfig_ that first needs to list all the figures before numbering them.
