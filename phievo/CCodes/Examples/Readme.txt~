In this directory, we provide explicit examples of specific  C codes (i.e. fitness definition, input definition and initialization of other variables)  and init file. test.py contains an example of network evolved.
- Adaptation is an example of evolution of adaptive networks based on maximization of one function and minimization of the other as published in Francois & Siggia, Phys Biol 2008. 
- StaticHox is an example of evolution of embryonic patterning based on a mutual info fitness  as published in Francois and Siggia, 2010, with input being a morphogen gradient
- SlidingHox is an example of evolution of embryonic patterning based on a mutual info fitness  as published in Francois and Siggia, 2010, with input being a sliding input step. For this example we initialize simulations with a predefined network in base.py (see function init_network() )
