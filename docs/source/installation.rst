Install Ï†-evo
=============

Since *phievo* is not pusblished on any official repository yet, you
need to install it manually.

install Anaconda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case python is not already installed on your computer, we recommand
to install it via the `anaconda
distribution <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__.

Among other things, anaconda provides the standard package manager of
python *pip*. *pip* can upgrade itself, it is generally recommanded to
do so before starting the installation process.

.. code:: bash

        pip3 install --upgrade pip

When python2 and python3 are installed on the same computer, it is
common to need to specify the version of python or pip you are using:
``python`` (``pip``) for python2 and ``python3`` (``pip3``) for python3.
Make sure you verify which command correspond to python3 on you
computer. In the following instruction you may need replace "pip3" by
"pip".

install the package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the root of the project, run the following command:

.. code:: bash

        sudo pip3 install dist/phievo-1.0.tar.gz

Instructions specific to windows
--------------------------------

Install gcc
~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows does not come with the ``gcc`` compiler installed but the free
software foundation provides a minimal distribution of the gnu softwares
for windows, it is called `MinGW <http://mingw.org/>`__.

Once you have downloaded ``mingw-get-setup.exe``, run it. A selection
panel will open. We recommend you to install at least the two following
packages(the others are not relevant for phievo): -
mingw-developper-toolkit - mingw32-base

Choose the default directory.

After the installation is finished, update windows ``PATH`` so that it
knows where to look for *gcc* command. Open a the command prompt and
run:

.. code:: bash

    setx PATH "%path%;C:\MinGW\bin"

**Note:** If you may use other coding distribution such as code blocks
or visual basics that already contain the *gcc* compiler. In such case,
you do not need to install MinGw. Just upload you ``PATH`` so that
windows knows where is the gcc compiler.

Instructions specific to OSX
----------------------------

Install gcc
~~~~~~~~~~~

OSX does not have the gcc compiler installed by default. There are
different way to install it. The fastest is probably via
`homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__:

.. code:: bash

    brew install gcc

If *gcc* is not already installed on you system (via macports or Xcode),
*homebrew*'s *gcc* should be automatically in the system's ``PATH``.

Install pygraphviz
------------------

*pygraphviz* is not istalled by default with *phievo* because it does
not exist natively on windows and we wanted to publish a version that
that run on al the systems. *pygraphviz* is used only to display network
layouts. If it is not install *phievo* will print a warning and use
*networkx* spring layout instead.

On max OSX, you have to use homebrew to install graphvix first :

.. code:: bash

    brew install graphviz pkg-config
    pip3 install pygraphviz

On GNU/linux, installing the dependencies varies depanding on the
distribution. We tested the following on debian and ubuntu

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install graphviz graphviz-dev pkg-config
    sudo pip3 install pygraphviz

On other distribution, you may want to find the equivalent of
*graphviz*, *graphviz-dev*, and *pkg-config*.

We found that sometimes on ubuntu the C linking to the graphviz library
does not work properly, to fix this, be more explicit on the linking:

.. code:: bash

    sudo pip3 install pygraphviz --install-option="--include-path=/usr/include/graphviz" --install-option="--library-path=/usr/lib/graphviz/"

Build the documentation
-----------------------

To build the documentation, go to the ``docs`` directory and run

.. code:: bash

    make html

the documentation is built in ``docs/build/html`` by default.

Note that you may need to run make html twice because the build process
uses the package *numfig* that first needs to list all the figures
before numbering them.

Analyse notebook
----------------

We provide a jupyter notebook to help with the analysis of the runs. If
you wand to run it, you will need to install several extra python
libraries, to help with this, they are writen in
`extra.txt <extra.txt>`__.

.. code:: bash

    pip3 install -r extra.txt
    jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix widgetsnbextension

Example: Static Hox
-------------------

Copy the project directory ``StaticHox`` from ``Examples`` where you
want to run it. Then copy ``run_evolution`` at the same place as
``StaticHox``.

To launch the evolution, simply run

.. code:: bash

        ./run_evolution.py -m StaticHox

On windows machine we recommand that you explicitly tell the system that
you are running python (make sure you use the good version).

.. code:: bash

        python run_evolution.py -m StaticHox
